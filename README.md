To compare the performance of variable selection using four methods: LASSO, RandomLASSO, Hi-LASSO and Stability Selection in high- and low-dimensional data, we simulate four datasets. Dataset I and dataset III are low dimensional, dataset II and dataset IV are high dimensional.  Dataset III and dataset IV are a scenario where there is relatively strong correlation among the covariates.
Two sets of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) values are considered: SNR = 2 and SNR = 5 for all four sets of simulations.
The results are shown by variable selection metrics: sensitivity, specificity, gmean, mcc and f1-score. MSE of each simulation is also returned to show the predictive accuracy of different models.
